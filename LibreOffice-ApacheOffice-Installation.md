## **Installing LibreOffice via RPM**

### **Step 1: Download the RPM Package**

Ensure you download the correct 64-bit RPM package for your system.

```
wget https://download.documentfoundation.org/libreoffice/stable/25.2.0/rpm/x86_64/LibreOffice_25.2.0_Linux_x86-64_rpm.tar.gz
```

### **Step 2: Transfer the Package Using SCP (If Downloaded on Another Machine)**

Use the **Secure Copy Protocol (SCP)** to transfer the downloaded package to your target machine.

```
scp <username-of-source>@<ip-of-source>:"<source-path-to-file>" <username-of-destination>@<ip-of-destination>:"<destination-path>"
```

**Examples:**

```
scp "C:/Users/user1/LibreOffice_25.2.0_Linux_x86-64_rpm.tar.gz" root@192.168.1.121:"/root/Downloads/"
```
```
scp user1@192.168.1.120:"C:/Users/user1/LibreOffice_25.2.0_Linux_x86-64_rpm.tar.gz" root@192.168.1.121:"/root/Downloads/"
```
```
scp user1@192.168.1.120:"C:/Users/user1/LibreOffice_25.2.0_Linux_x86-64_rpm.tar.gz" "/root/Downloads/"
```

**Note:** There is no need to specify the IP address and username if running the SCP command from the local machine.

### **Step 3: Uncompress the Downloaded Package**

The downloaded file is in **gzip** format. Use the `gunzip` command to uncompress it.

```
gunzip LibreOffice_25.2.0_Linux_x86-64_rpm.tar.gz
```

### **Step 4: Extract the Tar Archive**

The uncompressed file is a tar archive. Use the `tar` command to extract it.

```
tar -xvf LibreOffice_25.2.0_Linux_x86-64_rpm.tar
```

### **Step 5: Install All RPM Packages**

Navigate to the extracted RPM directory and install all packages.

```
cd LibreOffice_25.2.0.3_Linux_x86-64_rpm/RPMS/
```
```
rpm -ivh *.rpm
```
- This package includes all necessary dependencies, so installing all RPM files will resolve dependencies automatically.
- Administrative (root) privileges are required to install RPM packages system-wide.

### **Step 6: Verify Installation**

- **Login via GUI Mode:**
  - Open your desktop environment's application menu.
  - LibreOffice applications should be listed under the "Applications" section.
  - Launch any LibreOffice application (e.g., Writer) to confirm successful installation.

## **Uninstalling LibreOffice**

### **Step 1: List Installed LibreOffice Packages**

Run the following command to display all installed LibreOffice packages in a space-separated format.

```
ls | awk -F ".rpm" '{print $1}' | tr "\n" " "
```

### **Step 2: Remove All LibreOffice Packages**
