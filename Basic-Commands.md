### **Compression and Archive Tools**

**What is Compression?**  
Compression reduces file size for easier storage and transfer.

### 1) **bzip2**
   **Install**:  
   ```bash
   yum install bzip2
   ```
   **Compress**:  
   ```bash
   bzip2 filename
   bzip2 file1 file2
   bzip2 *.log
   ```
   **Decompress**:  
   ```bash
   bunzip2 filename.bz2
   bunzip2 *.log.bz2
   ```

### 2) **gzip**
   **Install**:  
   ```bash
   yum install gzip
   ```
   **Compress**:  
   ```bash
   gzip filename
   gzip -r foldername  # Recursive compression
   ```
   **Decompress**:  
   ```bash
   gunzip filename.gz
   gunzip *.gz  # Multiple files
   ```

### 3) **zip**
   **Install**:  
   ```bash
   yum install zip
   ```
   **Compress**:  
   ```bash
   zip file.zip filename
   zip -r file.zip foldername  # Compress folder
   ```
   **Decompress**:  
   ```bash
   unzip file.zip
   unzip -d destination_folder file.zip
   ```

### 4) **p7zip**
   **Install**:  
   ```bash
   yum install p7zip
   ```
   **Compress**:  
   ```bash
   7za a file.7z filename
   7za a archive.7z file1 file2
   ```
   **Decompress**:  
   ```bash
   7za e archive.7z
   7za x archive.7z  # Extract recursive folders
   ```

### 5) **tar**
   **Create archive**:  
   ```bash
   tar -cvf archive.tar files
   tar -cvf archive.tar file1 file2
   ```
   **Extract**:  
   ```bash
   tar -xvf archive.tar
   ```
   **Create and Compress**:  
   ```bash
   tar -cvjf archive.tbz files  # with bzip2 compression
   tar -xvf archive.tbz  # To extract
   ```


### **Pipes and Redirections in Linux**

**1) Redirect Output (`>`)**  
This command redirects the output of a command to a file, overwriting it if the file already exists.

**Example:**  
If you want to save the list of files in the current directory to a file called `files.txt`, use:
```bash
ls > files.txt  # Saves the output of 'ls' (file list) to files.txt, replacing its contents
```

---

**2) Append Output (`>>`)**  
Appends the output of a command to the end of a file without replacing the existing content.

**Example:**  
To add the current directory listing to `files.txt` without deleting the previous contents:
```bash
ls >> files.txt  # Adds the output of 'ls' to the end of files.txt
```

---

**3) Redirect Error Output (`2>`)**  
Redirects error messages (stderr) from a command to a file.

**Example:**  
If you want to capture any error messages from a failed command in `error.txt`:
```bash
ls non_existent_folder 2> error.txt  # Saves error messages to error.txt
```

---

**4) Redirect Both Output and Error (`&>` or `2>&1`)**  
Redirects both standard output (stdout) and error messages (stderr) to the same file.

**Example:**  
To save both output and errors to `output.txt`:
```bash
ls valid_folder non_existent_folder &> output.txt  # Both output and errors are saved to output.txt
```

---

**5) Pipe (`|`)**  
Sends the output of one command as input to another command.

**Example:**  
To count the number of files in the current directory:
```bash
ls | wc -l  # Sends the output of 'ls' to 'wc' to count the number of files
```

---

**6) Pipe with Multiple Commands**  
Chains several commands together, passing the output of one as the input to the next.

**Example:**  
To search for a word in files and count how many times it appears:
```bash
cat file.txt | grep "word" | wc -l  # Outputs the number of occurrences of "word"
```

---

**7) Redirect Input (`<`)**  
Uses a file as the input for a command, instead of entering it manually.

**Example:**  
To count the number of lines in a file, use:
```bash
wc -l < file.txt  # Uses file.txt as input to count lines
```

---

**8) Redirect Input and Output Simultaneously**  
Redirects both input from a file and output to a different file.

**Example:**  
To sort the contents of `input.txt` and save the sorted output to `output.txt`:
```bash
sort < input.txt > output.txt  # Takes input from input.txt and writes sorted output to output.txt
```

---

**9) Output to Multiple Files (`tee`)**  
The `tee` command lets you view output and save it to a file simultaneously.

**Example:**  
To display the output and also save it to `file.txt`:
```bash
echo "Hello, World!" | tee file.txt  # Displays the output and saves it to file.txt
```

---

**10) Discard Output (`/dev/null`)**  
Sends the output (or errors) to `/dev/null`, effectively discarding it.

**Example:**  
To discard any output from a command:
```bash
ls > /dev/null  # Discards standard output
```

To discard only error messages:
```bash
ls non_existent_folder 2> /dev/null  # Discards error messages
```

---

**11) Redirect Error to Output (`2>&1`)**  
Redirects error messages (stderr) to the same place as standard output (stdout).

**Example:**  
To capture both the output and error messages from a command:
```bash
ls valid_folder non_existent_folder 2>&1  # Combines both stdout and stderr
```

---

**12) Combining Input and Output Redirection**  
Redirects both input from a file and output to a different file at the same time.

**Example:**  
To take input from `input.txt` and save output to `output.txt`:
```bash
cat < input.txt > output.txt  # Reads from input.txt and writes to output.txt
```

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Here are the **5 MOST DANGEROUS COMMANDS**:

---

### **1) `rm -rf /`**  
This command will recursively and forcefully delete everything starting from the root directory (`/`), wiping out all system files, directories, and personal data. It will render the system completely unusable.

---

### **2) `sudo rm -rf /`**  
Running `rm -rf /` with `sudo` grants root privileges, bypassing any permission restrictions. This will delete the entire system, including important system files and directories, making the system unbootable.

---

### **3) `rm -rf ~/*`**  
This command will delete all files and directories in the current user's home directory (`~`), including personal files, configurations, and settings. It's particularly dangerous if run unintentionally in your home directory.

---

### **4) `rm -rf /dev/*`**  
The `/dev` directory contains critical device files for interacting with hardware. Deleting files from this directory will cause severe system issues, potentially making the system unable to access devices, such as storage and peripherals.

---

### **5) `rm -rf /bin /sbin /lib /lib64`**  
These directories contain essential system binaries and libraries. Removing these files will render the system unbootable, as these are required for basic system operations, including running commands and starting the system.

---

**Important Warning:** Always be extremely cautious with the `rm -rf` command, especially when using it as root. It can cause irreversible data loss or make the system unusable.
